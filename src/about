<h2>About</h2>
<p>Alpha College is a Christian, online school. It provides an opportunity for students to earn an associates degree or transfer to a bachelors degree program. Help students find an important piece of the puzzle when choosing a college or university.
The University has 44 colleges. This includes five permanent private halls (PPHs), which were founded by various Christian denominations and still retain their religious character. 
<br>
Alpha colleges are small, multidisciplinary communities. Each one has students, academic staff and administrative staff. Most colleges offer meals, libraries, accommodation, sports, events and other opportunities to enrich your Alpha College experience. The colleges have much in common, but each has its own character and history.<br>
  All graduate students belong to a department or faculty and a college or hall, except those taking non-matriculated courses. Supervision and teaching will be provided by your academic department, so no matter which college you belong to, this won't limit your access to potential supervisors or teaching staff; your course content is the same. </p>
