# Alpha College

Alpha College is a simple, client-side web application that allows users to navigate through different pages without refreshing the browser. It uses jQuery for dynamic content loading and ensures that the URL and page title are updated accordingly to reflect the content displayed.

## Features
- **No Backend**: The app is entirely front-end, without the need for any server-side backend.
- **Page Navigation**: Pages load dynamically upon click without refreshing the entire page, providing a seamless user experience.
- **URL and Title Update**: When a page is navigated to, both the URL and the page title are updated in the browser.
- **Accessible via URL**: Each page is accessible by its unique URL, allowing direct access to any section of the app.

## Technologies Used
- **jQuery**: Used for DOM manipulation and handling the dynamic loading of pages.

## How It Works
1. Clicking on any link will load the content for that page dynamically.
2. The URL in the browser will change to match the selected page, and the page title will also update.
3. Thereâ€™s no page refresh; only the necessary content is updated.

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
